# PodcastBackuper

Podcast Backuper allows you to have private copies of any podcast that has a RSS.

My motivation for this project is to keep a copy of podcasts and/or podcast episodes that disappear (are deleted by their creators).

For instance, many episodes of the Elixir Fountain podcast were deleted.

## Functionalities

- As a user, I want to download all information (audio, images, description, etc.) about all episodes of a given podcast (given its RSS file or link)


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `podcast_backuper` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:podcast_backuper, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/podcast_backuper>.
